# Scala WorkShop / Example

This is my project to archive the Scala lessons / examples and workshops which I created and I am going to make about Scala language.

This project is made by my experience, so can be improved by your contribution.

## Examples

The examples folders are:

 - scala-example-h1, it contains examples about Scala concepts, DSL, call by-name/by-value, functions and methods
 - scala-example-h2, it contains examples about Monoids, Monads, Hierachy and Polymorphism, Options and Futures
